-We will make the current one the master bot which is driven manually but has a capacity to communicate 
 with other bots 

-There will small bots which can swim in water and some can move on land 

-Master decides which one to deploy when and the use cases of group of bots will  be same.

-Different slave bots 
  - Move on land 
     - Camera,able to communicate to slave and move based on data from ultrasonic sensor 
     - states
          - standy 
          - passive - the device is on but has not reached exact spot to do its real job 
          - Active - remote survivalance with control from master 
		   - Move based on own intelligence and available sensor data.
          	   - send gps coordinates continously 
  - swim in water 
     - Under water camera ,able to communicate to slave and move based on data from laser and photo transistors       
       with water proof 
     - states
           - standby 
           - passive
           - Active   


Master bot 
- States 
    - Solomode
    - Master mode -- when its managing many slaves (different small bots)
    - Slave mode -- When its reporting to anothe bot of its own kind
    - Cordination- mode --Each of big bots needs to work on coredination 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A scanerio a air craft crash and bots are deployed in that scanerio , to judge and save passengers , since a crash was huge the wrekage is distributed all around sea
so the big bot works in cordination with slave bots the 

based on the data received the small bots detect a danger or emergency and send a message to Master bot 
Master transmits the data and asks for the emergency backup where the small detected danger 

Until the backup is received the suitation is monitored and small bot keeps sending data ,once the back is arrived the emergency message is stopped
